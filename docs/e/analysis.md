# Feature Analysis by AI
The primary source of Efw was provided to AI for feature analysis. The explanation of data flow and security is helpful.

## [Client Feature Analysis](client.magic.md)
The primary objective of the EFW framework is to provide **event-driven communication between the client (browser) and the server**, along with the consequent **automation of UI operations**.

## [Server Feature Analysis](server.magic.md)
The Efw server-side acts as an **event-driven middleware** that accepts AJAX/WebSocket requests, starting from the client's `Efw("eventId")` call. It leverages a powerful collaboration between **Java and server-side JavaScript** to seamlessly integrate authentication, validation, logic execution, and resource management.
